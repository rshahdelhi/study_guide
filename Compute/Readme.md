The objective of this course is to provide an introduction to compute services in AWS for solution architects, including:

Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2;
The Elastic Container Service, also known as ECS;
The Elastic Container Registry, or ECR;
The Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes, known as EKS;
AWS Elastic Beanstalk;
AWS Lambda; and
AWS Batch.
We’ll also introduce the concept of Elastic Load Balancing, along with the different types of load balancers you can provision within the AWS Cloud. We’ll discuss EC2 Auto Scaling and see how it works together with Elastic Load Balancing to help you build robust, highly available web applications. And finally we’ll discuss options for on-premises hybrid cloud architectures using AWS Outposts.

Together with the other courses in this learning path, we’ll cover all of the key tools, technologies, and concepts from the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam guide and ensure that you are fully prepared to sit this exam.

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification has been designed for anyone who has experience designing cloud solutions that use AWS services to meet current and future business requirements, as well as architectures that are secure, resilient, high-performing, and cost-optimized in accordance with the AWS Well-Architected Framework. All of the AWS Cloud concepts introduced in this course will be explained and reinforced from the ground up.
